    "Partitioning is a problem that often arises when working with data. For example, we may wonder how do we divide the data into groups so that each group has a similar total sum relative to all the other groups.  We can use dynamic programming to often solve problems of this nature where each computation step needs to consider multiple possibilities that led to that step. For example, what we decide to include in the first group of data has consequences to our determinations of data in future groups. Method aims to break the problem down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. Suppose we have an array of length n and we want to partition this array into k+1 sub groups by making k cuts, we can define the imbalance of the partition with a function such as below we want to minimize.
